# Dynamic_Endocast
Turning Matlab code into Python

Collaborators:

Description:
Dynamic endocast attempts to calculate the approximate volume of the inside of the mouth to better understand such change 
in volumne during the suction feeding event. This volumne difference is often used in other calculations such as power. This project will take previously written code in Matlab and convert it into Python, which will then be integrated as a package for Maya animations.
